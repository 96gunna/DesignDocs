# Testing the OED fast-pt compressed readings system

**We use the accompanying JS script `fastPtBenchmark.js` to perform these tests rather than manually because there are many tests and also because we found that using a script has no significant difference when compared to manually requesting data via the web interface.**

We test each data set as a way to observe the time taken for each switch level down the compressed readings function (compressed_readings_2 function).

To test OED, we load the following dataset:

| Dataset                  | Command to generate/Source   |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| 1-Minute Data for 1 year | generateOneMinuteTestingData |

## Default OED

We use a node script to time the average time (of 10 requests) it takes for a request for data to return. The elapsed time of the request is recorded in the rightmost column. We specifically chose intervals that provoke shifts in views in the db, and to test whether the amount of time take is linearly related to the amount of data points.

| Interval                                      | ~ Expected number of points | Actual number of points* | Expected View        | 1-Minute Data (ms) |

*There seems to consistently be one fewer point than expected. This could be either human calculation error or the boundary timestamps are not included.

**Based on the elapsed time of the request, the data was actually read from the hourly view.

## Observations

- Time to load data is not linearly proportionate to amount of data to load even within the same view
- Reading from a view is significantly slower than reading from either a materialized view or directly from a table
- Increase in space consumed may be beneficial depending on the underlying data resolution
- Though not recorded here, we observed a somewhat **linear** increase in time depending on the **amount of data** in the database.



## Case analysis on trade-off between materializing view and speed of hourly readings

**NOTE:** OED only contains reading data for 1 meter

**Underlying data:** 1-Minute Data for 1 year

**Space without materialized hourly view:** 218.9 MB

**Space with materialize hourly view:** 219.7 MB

**Changes to db**: We materialized the hourly view and modify the sql to read from the readings table (raw readings) instead of the minutely view.

| Interval                                      | Before changes (ms)* | After changes (ms) |

## Remaining Work

- Though not recorded here, we observed a somewhat **linear** increase in time depending on the **amount of data** in the database. This may suggest a problem in the indexing of the readings or meters tables.
- Closely check the impact on size of materialized view. When does size become an issue? The space data up by an empty is 57.3 MB.
- Rerun these tests on:
  - (Edge case) A large set of data (i.e. 10 years of data)
  - Different reading frequencies (23-minute, daily, etc...). We do not expect to see significant differences, but this should be done for completeness.
- Check the amount of time it takes to refresh (materialized) hourly readings. This is important because hourly readings view will have 24 times the data in the daily readings view. We are considering to use an hourly CRON job to update the hourly view, but a different strategy may be needed If refreshing takes a long time.
- Design and experiment with an intelligent data serving strategy that takes into account the expected length of readings, the max/expected reading length variations, and whether data is prone to having holes.



## Problems Experienced

Error loading 23-minute data: Bug with some startTimeStamps not being after the previous readings endTimeStamps. Error message pop-up is displayed below. The same bug was experienced with the loading the autogenerated 1-minute test data, but there were fewer such reading start-time errors to correct. However, even after correct these bugs the log file indicates that warnings with issues of inconsistent time-lengths.
